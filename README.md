*DESCRIPTION* : This project involves the development of a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library, in Python. The primary goal is to create a predictive model capable of classifying or predicting outcomes from a given dataset. A common example is spam email detection, where the model learns to categorize emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their characteristics.I have used spam mail dataset from kaggle as a demo file for the project for acessing the file panda library was used. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix are used to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The results of this evaluation are crucial for determining the model's effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. 
there are various application of this model following are few :-
1.Spam Detection: this is a classic application, filtering out unwanted emails.
2.Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card or banking systems.
3.Medical Diagnosis: Assisting in the diagnosis of diseases based on patient data.
4.Customer Churn Prediction: Predicting which customers are likely to stop using a service.
5.Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text data, such as customer reviews or social media posts.
6.Recommender Systems: Powering personalized recommendations in e-commerce or content streaming platforms.
7.Risk Assessment: Evaluating the risk associated with loans, insurance policies, or investments.
8.Image and Speech Recognition: Classifying images or transcribing spoken language.
